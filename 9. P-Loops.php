 */

// TASK 1: BASIC FOR LOOP
// Task: Use a for loop to display all numbers from 1 to 10, along with their squares.
//       Format the output to look like "Number: X, Square: Y"
// Hint: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) { code_to_execute; }

// Your code here


// TASK 2: FOR LOOP WITH STEP VALUE
// Task: Use a for loop to display all even numbers between 1 and 20.
//       Then modify it to display all odd numbers between 1 and 20.
// Hint: You can adjust the initialization and increment expressions to start at different values and skip numbers.

// Your code here


// TASK 3: NESTED FOR LOOPS
// Task: Create a multiplication table for numbers 1-5 using nested for loops.
//       Format the output in a readable table format.
// Hint: You need one loop inside another, where the outer loop represents rows and the inner loop represents columns.

// Your code here


// TASK 4: BASIC WHILE LOOP
// Task: Create a counter variable and use a while loop to display and increment it
//       until a certain condition is met (e.g., counter reaches 10).
// Hint: while (condition) { code_to_execute; increment_counter; }

// Your code here


// TASK 5: DO-WHILE LOOP
// Task: Use a do-while loop to implement a simple number guessing game where
//       the computer picks a number and gives "higher" or "lower" hints to the user.
//       (Simulate user input by setting a variable for each iteration)
// Hint: do { code_to_execute; } while (condition); -- code always executes at least once.

// Your code here


// TASK 6: FOREACH LOOP WITH INDEXED ARRAYS
// Task: Create an indexed array of colors and use foreach to display each color
//       along with its position in the array.
// Hint: foreach ($array as $value) { code_to_execute; }

// Your code here


// TASK 7: FOREACH LOOP WITH ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS
// Task: Create an associative array representing a person (name, age, job, etc.)
//       and use foreach to display each property and its value.
// Hint: foreach ($array as $key => $value) { code_to_execute; }

// Your code here


// TASK 8: FOREACH WITH NESTED ARRAYS
// Task: Create a multidimensional array (e.g., students with courses and grades)
//       and use nested foreach loops to display all the data in a structured format.
// Hint: You'll need a foreach inside another foreach to iterate through the nested structures.

// Your code here


// TASK 9: LOOP CONTROL - BREAK
// Task: Create a loop that's supposed to run 100 times, but use the break statement
//       to exit the loop when a specific condition is met (e.g., a random number is generated).
// Hint: break; immediately exits the loop it's inside.

// Your code here


// TASK 10: LOOP CONTROL - CONTINUE
// Task: Create a loop that iterates from 1 to 20, but use the continue statement
//       to skip certain iterations based on a condition (e.g., skip multiples of 3).
// Hint: continue; skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next one.

// Your code here


// TASK 11: LABELED BREAKS AND CONTINUES
// Task: Create nested loops and use labeled break/continue to control the outer loop
//       from within the inner loop.
// Hint: break 2; or continue 2; affects the loop that is 2 levels up.

// Your code here


// TASK 12: INFINITE LOOPS WITH CONDITIONAL BREAKS
// Task: Create an intentional infinite loop (while(true) or for(;;)) and use conditional
//       break statements to exit the loop when appropriate.
//       Demonstrate a practical use case for this pattern.
// Hint: Infinite loops can be useful when the exit condition is complex or unknown in advance.

// Your code here
