// TASK 1: ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
// Task: Demonstrate all arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **) with different numeric types (integers and floats).
//       Show examples of operator precedence and how parentheses affect the order of operations.
// Hint: The ** operator is for exponentiation and % is the modulo operator for remainder after division.

// Your code here


// TASK 2: ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
// Task: Use all assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, .=) in examples.
//       Explain the difference between simple assignment and compound assignments.
// Hint: Compound assignment operators perform an operation and assign in one step. The .= operator is for string concatenation.

// Your code here


// TASK 3: STRING OPERATORS
// Task: Demonstrate string concatenation using the dot (.) operator and the concatenating assignment (.=) operator.
//       Show string interpolation within double quotes as an alternative.
// Hint: The dot operator joins strings, while variable interpolation works only in double quotes.

// Your code here


// TASK 4: INCREMENT/DECREMENT OPERATORS
// Task: Demonstrate both pre-increment (++$var), post-increment ($var++), pre-decrement (--$var), and post-decrement ($var--).
//       Show examples of these operators in expressions to highlight the difference between pre and post operations.
// Hint: Pre-increment changes the value before using it in the expression; post-increment uses the original value in the expression.

// Your code here


// TASK 5: COMPARISON OPERATORS
// Task: Use all comparison operators (==, ===, !=, <>, !==, <, >, <=, >=, <=>) with different data types.
//       Explain the difference between loose (==) and strict (===) comparison.
// Hint: Strict comparison (===, !==) checks both value and type; loose comparison (==, !=) only checks value.

// Your code here


// TASK 6: LOGICAL OPERATORS
// Task: Demonstrate the use of logical operators (&&/AND, ||/OR, !/NOT, XOR) in different conditions.
//       Show operator precedence and short-circuit evaluation with examples.
// Hint: Short-circuit evaluation means the second condition may not be evaluated if the first condition determines the result.

// Your code here
